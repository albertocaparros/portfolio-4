However, as applications like Gmail and Google Maps began offering rich, interactive experiences, it became clear that the traditional model was no longer sufficient.\n\nThe classic model required full-page reloads for every interaction, which disrupted user experience. Dynamic features (such as real-time updates or interactive maps) demanded smoother, more immediate interactions that server-only rendering couldn’t efficiently provide.\n\nThe introduction of AJAX allowed developers to fetch data asynchronously and update parts of a page without reloading the entire document. This shift pushed more logic to the browser, paving the way for a clear separation between frontend (UI/interaction) and backend (data processing, business logic).\n\n## Emergence of the Frontend-Backend Separation - Early Client Libraries\n\nAs the client side started handling more responsibilities, it became evident that managing increasingly complex interactions and state within the browser required more structure than ad hoc jQuery scripts or simple DOM manipulations. Code bases became difficult to maintain as interactivity increased, and it was challenging to keep the application state consistent. Especially when multiple parts of a page were interacting with each other asynchronously.\n\nThe growing complexity led to the early adoption of MVC (Model-View-Controller) or MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) patterns on the client side. Frameworks such as Backbone.js and, eventually, AngularJS started to appear to address these needs. This era marked the clear separation between frontend and backend responsibilities. Frontend evolved into its own discipline, focused on delivering interactive, stateful user interfaces while the backend handled data persistence, business logic, and security.\n\n## Modern Frontend Frameworks: Consolidation and Evolution\n\nAs web applications grew even more complex, the demands on the client side led to the birth of robust frameworks that would not only manage interactivity but also simplify development at scale.\n\n- **Angular**:\nOriginating as AngularJS and later re-architected into Angular 2+, Google’s Angular introduced a comprehensive, opinionated framework. It came equipped with dependency injection, two-way data binding, and a complete suite of tools for testing and building enterprise-level applications. This approach offered a clear path for developers to handle large-scale projects with consistent patterns.\n\n- **React**:\nDeveloped by Facebook, React shifted the focus solely to the view layer. Its component-based architecture, virtual DOM, and one-way data flow provided a flexible and efficient way to build interactive user interfaces. React’s minimal core and the rich ecosystem that grew around it (such as Redux for state management) made it highly adaptable to various project needs.\n\n- **Vue**:\nVue emerged as a progressive framework that blended the strengths of both Angular and React. It offered an approachable learning curve, flexibility, and a set of integrated features ideal for building dynamic user interfaces. Vue’s scalability and simplicity have earned it a strong following among developers working on both small projects and large-scale applications.\n\n## Why This Evolution?\n\nAll three frameworks embraced a component-based model, which naturally arose from the need to manage complex, interactive interfaces. This paradigm promoted reusability, modularity, and easier maintenance.\n\nAs user interactions and dynamic data became more prevalent, managing application state efficiently and ensuring high performance were critical. Frameworks evolved to address these challenges, whether through built-in solutions (as in Angular) or via companion libraries (as in React).\n\nThe rise of these frameworks was also fueled by the strong communities and ecosystems that formed around them. This support network accelerated the development of tools, best practices, and learning resources, further solidifying their roles in modern web development.","src/content/blog/why-frontend.md","ea6a3b6181f094f7",{"html":63,"metadata":64},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1600132806608-231446b2e7af?q=80&#x26;w=350\" alt=\"Sketch of a website\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the-rise-of-rich-web-applications\">The Rise of Rich Web Applications\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Before major frontend frameworks emerged, most websites were built with server-rendered pages (using technologies like PHP, ASP.NET, or JSP).

In the early 1990s, **Tim Berners-Lee** developed HTML at CERN as a way for scientists to *connect* and *navigate* through related documents via hyperlinks. Its simplicity was its strength: using a handful of tags to define headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. HTML quickly became the primary language for building and navigating the web.\n\nThe primary reasons behind HTML’s creation were:\n\n- **Simplicity and Accessibility**: It provided an uncomplicated way to *structure* text and *link* documents, making information available across diverse computing systems.\n\n- **Universality**: Its lightweight, text-based nature meant that any device capable of rendering text could display HTML pages, which was essential in a time when computing environments were highly varied.\n\nThis features helped HTML establish itself as the main language of the web, serving as the common denominator for information sharing across the newly emerging network of computers.\n\n## Evolution\n\nAs the web expanded, so did the demands placed on HTML. Early web pages were static and straightforward, but soon there was demand for *dynamic* and *visually engaging* content that exposed the limitations of the original markup. This led to several iterations and refinements:\n\n- **HTML 2.0** (1995):\nThe first standardized version, HTML 2.0, codified the basic elements and laid the groundwork for consistent document structure. It was a formal recognition of HTML's importance, ensuring that content could be reliably rendered across different browsers.\n\n- **HTML 3.2** (1997):\nWith the rapid growth of the web, HTML 3.2 introduced additional tags and attributes—many of which were presentation-oriented. Developers began to use elements like &lt;font&gt; and &lt;center&gt; to control layout and style, even though this mixed content with presentation. The need to display richer information spurred this expansion.\n\n- **HTML 4.01** (1999):\nHTML 4.01 marked a turning point by emphasizing the separation of content and presentation. With the concurrent emergence of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), HTML was encouraged to focus on the semantic structure of documents while leaving styling to CSS. This iteration promoted better accessibility and maintainability, laying the foundation for modern web development practices.\n\nThese iterations were driven by the desire to address practical challenges:\n\n- **Consistent Rendering**: As more browsers emerged, standardization became crucial to ensure that pages looked and behaved similarly across platforms.\n\n- **Enhanced Functionality**: The evolution of web design demanded more expressive markup that could support richer interactions and diverse content types.\n\n- **Separation of Concerns**: Moving styling out of HTML and into CSS improved both the maintainability and accessibility of web content.\n\n## HTML5 and the Modern Web\n\nBy the time HTML5 was introduced, the web had transformed into a platform for highly interactive, multimedia-rich applications. The limitations of earlier HTML versions had become increasingly apparent, prompting a comprehensive overhaul to meet modern demands.\n\nKey motivations and changes in HTML5 include:\n\n- **Rich Multimedia Support**:\nEarlier versions of HTML required third-party plugins (like Flash) to handle audio and video. HTML5 introduced native &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; tags, empowering developers to integrate multimedia content seamlessly and securely without relying on external software.\n\n- **Semantic Markup**:\nRecognizing the importance of meaningful structure, HTML5 introduced new semantic elements such as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;. These elements help browsers and assistive technologies better understand the content, improving accessibility and search engine optimization.\n\n- **Advanced APIs and Interactivity**:\nHTML5 isn’t just a markup language—it’s also a platform. With built-in APIs for tasks like geolocation, offline storage (later enhanced by Service Workers), and dynamic graphics via the &lt;canvas&gt; element, HTML5 provides a robust framework for developing interactive applications.\n\n- **Responsive and Mobile-First Design**:\nAs mobile devices became ubiquitous, HTML5 incorporated features (like the &lt;meta&gt; viewport tag) to support responsive design. This ensures that web applications render correctly on a wide range of devices, from desktops to smartphones.\n\n- **Progressive Enhancement**:\nHTML5 encourages a design philosophy where the core content remains accessible, even if a browser doesn’t support all the advanced features. This principle ensures a more inclusive web, where every user can access the basic content regardless of their device or browser capabilities.\n\nIn essence, HTML5 was born from the necessity to address the modern web’s challenges—rich *interactivity*, *accessibility*, and a seamless *user experience* across diverse devices. Its thoughtful additions and improvements reflect decades of learning and adaptation, setting the stage for today’s dynamic, responsive web applications.","src/content/blog/html-evolution.md","f1a3d8b4eaf5e063",{"html":99,"metadata":100},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583339793403-3d9b001b6008?q=80&#x26;w=350\" alt=\"HTML code\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"birth-of-html\">Birth of HTML\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>HTML was born out of a need to share information easily.

In HTML5 the declaration is:\n\n```\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n```\nAnd serves two purposes:\n\n- **Triggers Standards Mode**:\nIt instructs browsers to render the document using the latest web standards rather than falling back to “quirks mode.” Quirks mode emulates non-standard, legacy behavior from older browsers, which can lead to inconsistent layouts and unexpected styling issues.\n\n- **Signals Modern HTML Usage**:\nWith HTML5, the need for verbose DTD (Document Type Definition) references was eliminated. The simplified DOCTYPE confirms that your document adheres to the modern, semantic standards of HTML5, ensuring consistency across all modern browsers.\n\n## Metadata: Character encoding\n\nWithout a specified character encoding, browsers may guess how to interpret the bytes in an HTML document. This can lead to misrendered text—especially for non-English languages, symbols, or special characters—resulting in garbled output or incorrect symbols.\n\nThe &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt; tag explicitly tells the browser to use the UTF-8 encoding, which supports virtually every character and symbol used in modern languages. This ensures that text displays correctly, regardless of the language or special characters, making your web pages both robust and internationally accessible.\n\n## Metadata: Viewport\n\nMobile devices have a wide variety of screen sizes and resolutions. By default, many mobile browsers assume a page is designed for a larger desktop screen, causing them to scale down the content. This often leads to pages that appear too small and require users to zoom or scroll horizontally—resulting in a poor user experience.\n\nThe tag **&lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"&gt;** instructs the browser to set the viewport width to the device’s actual width and to render the page at a 1:1 scale (i.e., no initial zoom). This allows the layout to adjust dynamically to the screen size, enabling responsive design and ensuring that content is legible and accessible on all devices.\n\n## Semantic Markup\n\nSemantic markup solves the problem of ambiguous, non-descriptive HTML by providing meaning to content structure. This approach addresses several key problems:\n\n- **Accessibility**:\nWithout semantic markup, assistive technologies (such as screen readers) struggle to interpret the structure and meaning of content. Using elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; provides clear landmarks that help users with disabilities navigate a page effectively.\n\n- **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**:\nSearch engines rely on semantic cues to understand the hierarchy and context of content. When you use semantic elements, you improve a page's clarity, which can lead to better indexing and higher search rankings.\n\n- **Maintainability and Readability**\nSemantic markup makes the code more self-explanatory. Developers can more easily understand and maintain a codebase when the structure reflects the actual content, reducing the risk of errors and simplifying future updates.\n\n## ARIA \n\nARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a set of attributes designed to enhance the accessibility of web content, especially for dynamic or custom UI components that aren’t natively accessible.\n\nModern web applications often involve interactive and dynamic components—like custom widgets, modals, tabs, and live regions—that traditional HTML alone cannot fully describe in terms of their roles, states, and relationships. Without additional context, assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) may struggle to interpret these elements correctly.\n\nARIA introduces a series of attributes (such as role, aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-describedby, aria-expanded, and aria-hidden) that you can add to HTML elements to provide explicit information about their purpose and behavior\n\n- **Roles**: Define what an element represents (e.g., *role=\"dialog\"* for a modal or *role=\"navigation\"* for a navigation bar).\n- **States and Properties**: Convey dynamic states (e.g., *aria-expanded=\"true\"* on an expandable menu) and relationships between elements (e.g., linking labels with *aria-labelledby*).\n- **Descriptive Labels**: Provide text alternatives and descriptions for custom components that lack inherent semantic meaning.","src/content/blog/why-first-html.md","15f501ed64a97015",{"html":130,"metadata":131},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/02/22/17/27/programming-3173456_960_720.png\" alt=\"A screen with closing html tag\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"doctype-declaration\">DOCTYPE Declaration\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The DOCTYPE declaration is a directive that tells the browser which version of HTML to use when rendering a page.

But retrieving a user’s location reliably and securely was a challenge.\n\nThe *Geolocation API* provides a simple, asynchronous interface that (after obtaining user permission) retrieves the device’s geographic coordinates. This lets developers integrate location features directly into their applications without relying on external plugins.\n\n## Web Storage API (localStorage and sessionStorage)\n\nTraditional cookies were limited in size, sent with every HTTP request (affecting performance), and lacked a straightforward way to persist data on the client side for dynamic web applications.\n\nThe *Web Storage API* introduces two storage mechanisms:\n\n- **localStorage**: Stores data with no expiration date, making it ideal for persisting user settings or application state between sessions.\n\n- **sessionStorage**: Stores data only for the duration of the page session.\n\nBoth provide a simple key-value interface, are not sent with every request, and offer significantly larger storage capacity compared to cookies.\n\n## Canvas API\n\nCreating dynamic and interactive graphics (such as game visuals, data visualizations, or custom drawing applications) used to require external plugins or cumbersome workarounds.\n\nThe *Canvas API* gives developers a drawable region directly in the browser. Using JavaScript, you can render 2D shapes, images, and text, manipulate pixels, and even create animations. This provides a flexible and powerful solution for generating dynamic graphics without needing third-party tools.\n\n## Web Workers API\n\nIntensive computations or data processing tasks can block the main UI thread, leading to unresponsive interfaces and poor user experience.\n\n*Web Workers* allow scripts to run in background threads separate from the main execution thread. This enables developers to offload heavy tasks (such as data crunching, image processing, or real-time calculations) without freezing the user interface, resulting in smoother and more responsive web applications.\n\n## WebSockets API\n\nTraditional HTTP communication is unidirectional and involves overhead from request/response cycles, making real-time, bidirectional data exchange inefficient.\n\nThe *WebSockets API* establishes a persistent, full-duplex communication channel between the client and server over a single TCP connection. This allows both sides to send data at any time, reducing latency and overhead, which is ideal for real-time applications.\n\n## IndexedDB API\n\nFor complex web applications (especially those requiring offline capabilities) there’s a need to store and query large volumes of structured data on the client side. Traditional storage methods like cookies or localStorage aren’t sufficient for these requirements.\n\n*IndexedDB* is a low-level, NoSQL database that runs in the browser. It allows you to store significant amounts of structured data and perform complex queries. This makes it ideal for applications like offline-first web apps, client-side caching, and progressive web apps (PWAs).\n\n## Fetch API\n\nMaking HTTP requests using the older XMLHttpRequest was verbose, callback-heavy, and less intuitive. Especially for modern asynchronous code.\n\nThe *Fetch API* offers a promise-based, streamlined interface for performing network requests. It simplifies the process of fetching resources and handling responses, making the code more readable and easier to maintain.\n\n## History API\n\nSingle-page applications (SPAs) require a way to manage navigation and update the URL without triggering a full page reload, ensuring a smooth user experience.\n\nThe *History API* (using methods like pushState and replaceState) enables developers to manipulate the browser's history stack. This allows for dynamic URL changes and state management in SPAs without refreshing the page, supporting both navigation and deep linking.","src/content/blog/html-built-in-apis.md","5c7142f2b10cadf8",{"html":168,"metadata":169},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://images.pexels.com/photos/38271/ipad-map-tablet-internet-38271.jpeg?auto=compress&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;w=350&#x26;dpr=1\" alt=\"A screen with closing html tag\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"geolocation-api\">Geolocation API\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Many web applications need to offer location-based services, such as finding nearby restaurants, mapping services, or local weather.

This tangled approach made it difficult to maintain and update designs, as style changes often meant altering the content markup directly.\n\nCSS was introduced to separate content from presentation. This meant that HTML could focus solely on structure, while CSS took care of layout, typography, colors, and other visual aspects. It also aimed to solve problems of consistency and efficiency. By centralizing styling rules, developers could ensure a consistent look and feel across an entire website and make global changes more efficiently.\n\nWith the introduction of CSS, a single stylesheet could govern the design of multiple pages, making maintenance easier and lowering redundancy. The cascading nature of CSS allowed styles to be inherited and overridden as needed, providing flexibility without sacrificing consistency.\n\n## Evolution\n\nAs web design became more ambitious, the limitations of early CSS surfaced. Developers grappled with issues like inconsistent browser implementations, rigid layouts, and the lack of advanced design capabilities.\n\n- **Browser Inconsistencies**:\nEarly on, different browsers interpreted CSS rules differently, leading to unpredictable layouts. This spurred the development of CSS resets and normalization techniques to standardize behavior. The ongoing refinement of the CSS specification led to better-defined models and more predictable behavior across browsers.\n\n- **The Box Model and Layout issues**:\nUnderstanding and working with the CSS box model was challenging, particularly when browsers applied it differently. Developers used workarounds like floats and hacks to create multi-column layouts; a messy solution that highlighted CSS’s early limitations. The evolution from float-based layouts to more robust solutions (like Flexbox) addressed many of the early challenges of aligning and distributing elements.\n\n- **Limited Interactivity and Dynamic Styling**:\nEarly CSS lacked the ability to adapt dynamically to different devices and user interactions. This led to the introduction of media queries and more expressive selectors, paving the way for responsive design. This allowed developers to design for multiple devices, fundamentally changing the way web experiences were crafted.\n\n## CSS nowadays\n\nToday’s web demands dynamic, responsive, and maintainable designs that can adapt seamlessly across an array of devices and screen sizes. \n\nOver the past decade, external tools like *Sass*, *LESS*, and *PostCSS* filled the gaps in native CSS by introducing features such as variables, nesting, and mixins, which made stylesheets more modular and easier to manage. These innovations not only solved immediate challenges but also influenced the evolution of CSS itself, leading to the integration of many of these features directly into the language. As a result, modern CSS now offers powerful, built-in solutions like Flexbox, CSS Grid, and CSS Variables, reflecting a natural progression shaped by real-world developer needs and community-driven experimentation.\n\nIt's interesting to take a look at the modern solutions implemented and to think about the rationale behind them:\n\n- **Flexbox and CSS Grid**:\nThese layout systems were introduced to provide developers with intuitive tools for creating complex, responsive layouts without resorting to hacky workarounds. Flexbox excels at one-dimensional layouts (either row or column), while CSS Grid is built for two-dimensional layouts, making it easier to design sophisticated, grid-based interfaces.\n\n- **CSS Variables (Custom Properties)**: Maintaining consistency in design and allowing for dynamic theming was a challenge with static values. CSS variables enable reusable values that can be updated in one place, allowing for greater flexibility and easier theming.\n\n- **Advanced Selectors and Pseudo-Classes**: As web interfaces became more interactive, there was a need for precise styling without bloating HTML with extra classes. CSS provides advanced selectors and pseudo-classes (like *:nth-child*, *:not*, *:hover*, etc.) that allow for fine-grained control over element styling, reducing reliance on additional markup.\n\n- **Transitions, Animations, and Transformations**:\nCreating smooth, engaging user experiences without heavy JavaScript was a key goal. CSS transitions and animations allow developers to add subtle motion and visual feedback directly within the stylesheet, enhancing interactivity and user experience while offloading work from JavaScript.\n\n- **Modular and Component-Based Styling**:\nAs applications grew, the need for maintainable and scalable CSS became more pressing. Techniques like CSS Modules, BEM (Block Element Modifier), and even CSS-in-JS solutions emerged to promote reusable, encapsulated styles, reducing conflicts and making large-scale projects more manageable.","src/content/blog/css-evolution.md","9aff46a7c8ca8dfa",{"html":216,"metadata":217},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523437113738-bbd3cc89fb19?q=80&#x26;w=350\" alt=\"A screen with css code\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"birth-of-css\">Birth of CSS\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Before CSS, HTML was used not only to structure content but also to control presentation.
