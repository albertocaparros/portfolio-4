# Introducing my approach to Frontend Development learning

This guide begins, as many things in life do, with a problem. I am searching for a new position in frontend development and preparing for the interviews ahead. It is hard _not_ to be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of knowledge you _might_ be asked about.

> Routing, Responsive Web Design, Lazy loading, Accessibility, Optimization, SEO, Different Architectures, State Management, <small>Data structures and algorights, Testing, Debugging, Memoization, CSS-in-JS, Change detection, Cookies & Storage, <sub>Promises, Async/Await, Server-Side Rendering...</sub></small>

I think you get the idea.

And that's just the _general_ topics - never mind the specific details of the particular library or framework you'll be working with. Not only do I lack the time to prepare as thoroughly as I’d like, but I also don’t believe it should be necessary. Having worked in software engineering for a while, I know that at its core, our job is actually quite simple: our software’s clients have a problem, and we need to provide them with a solution.

## But _Why_

We’re far enough along in software development that reinventing the wheel doesn’t make sense. The way we truly get better at our jobs is by improving our **understanding** of the problems, and by knowing **why** different solutions were created by talented engineers.

- Why do we even need frontend development?
- Why did React choose a Virtual DOM approach, and how does it solve performance and complexity issues?
- Why does Vite exist if Webpack is already so popular?

By systematically uncovering the _problems_ and _constraints_ that gave birth to these solutions, we gain:

1. _Deeper Understanding_: We can connect the dots between seemingly unrelated tools or techniques.
2. _Transferable Skills_: If you know why a solution exists, you can evaluate new tools more effectively and make better decisions.
3. _Better Interview Readiness_: You won't just parrot facts; you'll engage in _reasoning_ about trade-offs and design considerations.

## What to Expect Next

In upcoming posts, I’ll share a series of articles that trace frontend development from its broadest purpose ("Why do we need web apps?") down to specific questions ("Why do custom hooks exist in React?"). Each post will highlight the **problems** that prompted a particular solution, the **constraints** that shaped it, and the **benefits** it provides.

_Happy coding, and remember: always ask “why.”_
