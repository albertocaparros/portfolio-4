					For some reason, I have two very distinct memories from my childhood
					related to computers. First one is being able to run the game
					Dangerous Dave with a MS-DOS command as a kid. (Yes, I'm that old ðŸ˜…).
					The second one is creating my first website about Final Fantasy VII
					and VIII using old HTML. I still have nightmares about &lt;table&lt;
					and &lg;marquee&lg;.

					Considering my early interest, it was an easy decision to choose
					Computer Science for my university degree. I studied in Spain,
					although but that time I already lived for a few months in Edinburgh,
					and soon after I entered the Erasmus program to study one year abroad
					in WrocÅ‚aw, Poland. It was the beginning of my interest in knowing
					other places in the world. Before I finished my degree I did a
					traineeship in IBM Belgium, and soon after that I went back for
					another stage at the European Commission.

					Right after that I spent one year in Australia with a working-holidays
					visa. Even thought I wasn't working professionally in software
					development during that time, I loved the experience and I had time to
					join programming events and hackatons. In fact I loved it so much that
					after one year working in Spain, I repeated with my second
					working-holiday experience, this time in Japan.

					Nowadays, when I'm not busy with work, I'm focused on moving my career
					towards front-end development. Participating in programming
					communities, building portfolio projects and learning as much as I
					can.
